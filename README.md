# Landsat-Sentinel-Obs

 GEE Javascript API scripts for obtaining the number of cloudless observations using Landsat 4, 5, 7, 8 (Landsat-Obs) or Sentinel-2 (Sentinel2-Obs) in BR. Duplicated observations from overlapping image tiles are counted only once using both collections. The two scripts export annual and monthly images (by year), as well as a table containing the metadata of all images. The images that resulted from these scripts were afterwards downloaded and analyzed using R. Both the GEE and R scripts can be found in their respective folders (GEE and R).
